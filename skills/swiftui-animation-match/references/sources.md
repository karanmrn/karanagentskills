# Source Index

Every catalog file in this skill is derived from one animation source
(usually a GitHub repo). This index records where each catalog came from,
which revision was read, and the license terms for lifting code.

Read the source's actual code before adapting an entry; catalogs summarize,
they do not replace the source.

## Staleness policy

- Each catalog pins the commit it was read at. When a source gains
  significant new animations, re-run the analysis (see
  [adding-a-source.md](adding-a-source.md), which covers refreshes too)
  and update the pinned commit.
- If a catalog path 404s against the live repo, the source moved or was
  renamed: re-verify against the pinned commit, then refresh the catalog.
  Checking out the pin requires history — clone without `--depth 1`, or
  run `git fetch --unshallow` (or `git fetch origin <sha> --depth 1`) in an
  existing shallow clone before `git checkout <sha>`. The pin can only be
  missing if upstream rewrote history; in that case re-catalog from the
  current tip.

## Candidate sources (not yet cataloged)

Add repos here when they are worth cataloging but the analysis has not been
done yet — this is the queue for future additions. None currently queued.
